# Smart roads start with smart infrastructure
With smart road technology, a safer and more sustainable future of transportation is right around the corner.

Sensors, AI, and intelligent cameras are some of the driving IoT technologies that make smart infrastructure possible. 
Intel and our partners have developed technologies and hardware to assist in edge and cloud computing for smart road technology.
We provide prevalidated reference designs and reference implementations to enable solutions that modernize road infrastructure.
